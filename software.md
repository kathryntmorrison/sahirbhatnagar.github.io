* [acm4r](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/acm4r/index.html)  
Fragment lengths or molecular weights from pairs of lanes are compared, and a number of matching bands are calculated using the Align-and-Count Method.

* [eclust](http://sahirbhatnagar.com/eclust/)  
A Statistical Software Tool for the Analysis of High-Dimensional Interactions. This software is written in the open source software environment R. It's main functionality is to fit statistical models for analyzing interactions between a high dimensional dataset (e.g. genomics, brain imaging), the environment and a response.

* [casebase](http://sahirbhatnagar.com/casebase/)  
This software is written in the open source software environment R. It's main functionality is to fit smooth-in-time parametric hazard functions using case-base sampling. This approach allows the explicit inclusion of the time variable into the model, which enables the user to fit a wide class of parametric hazard functions. For example, including time linearly recovers the Gompertz hazard, whereas including time logarithmically recovers the Weibull hazard; not including time at all corresponds to the exponential hazard. This is joint work with [Maxime Turgeon](http://turgeonmaxime.github.io/), [Olli Saarela](http://individual.utoronto.ca/osaarela/) and [James Hanley](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/)
